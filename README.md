## üöÄ **Description**

Technology: 
> + Docker
> + Docker-compose
> + Containerization

This project consists in having you set up a small infrastructure composed of different services under specific rules. The whole project has to be done in a virtual machine. You have to use docker-compose.

The application that we should succeed consists of three containers:
> + A Docker container that contains NGINX with TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3 only.
> + A Docker container that contains WordPress + php-fpm only without nginx.
> + A Docker container that contains MariaDB only without nginx.

Also, each container must have its own volumes, and also all three containers must have a docker-network.
